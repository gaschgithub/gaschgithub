## Pablo Gallegos Noreña

Music Technology Researcher · Audio Specialist

I work at the intersection of music, computation, and perception, with a focus on rhythm, timing, and algorithmic sound systems. My reasearch combines symbolic and audio-based analysis, practice-driven tool development, and generative approaches to sound and music.

### Research interests
- Algorithmic and generative sound systems
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Machine Learning for sound and music
- Microrhythm analysis and timing
- Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
- Symbolic music processing (MIDI)

### Tools
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Essentia (audio feature extraction and analysis)
- MIDI data processing
- REAPER (Lua scripting and automation)
- SuperCollider (sclang)
- Sonic Visualiser
- Audacity
- Git (research-oriented version control)

### Background
Bachelor’s degree in Music and Artistic Technology, specialized in Applied Music Technology Management (UNAM).  
Experience in music production, dialogue editing, film sound, and game audio, with a strong interest in applying computational methods within real music and audio practices.
